## Deployment Process

### âœ… Pre-Deployment Steps
- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify local build works
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test API endpoints locally with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify health endpoint responds correctly

### âœ… Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Vercel CLI installed (`npm i -g vercel`)
- [ ] Logged into Vercel (`vercel login`)
- [ ] Project deployed (`vercel --prod` or use `./deploy.sh`)
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)

### âœ… Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health endpoint responding: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] Extract audio endpoint accepting requests: `POST /api/extract-audio`
- [ ] Status endpoint working: `GET /api/status/[jobId]`
- [ ] Download endpoint working: `GET /api/download/[jobId]`
- [ ] Error responses are properly formatted
- [ ] HTTPS working correctly

## Production Configuration

### âœ… Vercel Blob Storage
- [ ] Blob store created in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` configured

- [ ] File cleanup strategy implemented

### âœ… Performance & Limits
- [ ] Function timeout set to 60 seconds (or appropriate for your use case)
- [ ] Memory limits understood and configured
- [ ] File size limits implemented (recommended: 100MB max)
- [ ] Rate limiting considered (if needed)

### âœ… Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Health check endpoint implemented
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring set up
- [ ] Vercel Analytics enabled (optional)

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Rate limiting (if needed)
- [ ] Input sanitization implemented

### âœ… Data Protection
- [ ] Temporary files cleaned up after processing
- [ ] No sensitive data logged
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Blob storage access properly configured

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Functional Testing
- [ ] Test with valid Google Drive URLs
- [ ] Test with invalid URLs (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test with unsupported file formats
- [ ] Test with large files (within limits)
- [ ] Test job status polling
- [ ] Test file download functionality

### âœ… Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Test missing environment variables
- [ ] Test network failures
- [ ] Test FFmpeg processing errors
- [ ] Test blob storage failures
- [ ] Test timeout scenarios

### âœ… Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent requests
- [ ] Verify memory usage stays within limits
- [ ] Test processing time for different file sizes
- [ ] Verify cleanup happens correctly

## Go-Live Checklist

### âœ… Final Verification
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team trained on monitoring and troubleshooting
- [ ] Backup/rollback plan in place
- [ ] Support contacts documented

### âœ… Launch Preparation
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards set up
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured
- [ ] Documentation accessible to users
- [ ] API usage examples ready
- [ ] Support process defined

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### âœ… Daily Checks
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check function execution times
- [ ] Verify blob storage usage
- [ ] Review logs for issues

### âœ… Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Analyze usage patterns
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check for security issues
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed

### âœ… Monthly Maintenance
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Test locally
npm run dev
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Deploy to production
./deploy.sh
# OR manually:
vercel --prod

# Check deployment
vercel ls
vercel logs

# Test production
curl https://your-api.vercel.app/api/health

# Set environment variables
vercel env add BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
```

## Emergency Procedures

### âœ… If API is Down
1. Check Vercel status page
2. Review function logs in Vercel Dashboard
3. Verify environment variables
4. Check blob storage status
5. Rollback to previous deployment if needed

### âœ… If Processing Fails
1. Check FFmpeg WebAssembly loading
2. Verify file download capabilities
3. Check blob storage permissions
4. Review timeout settings
5. Monitor memory usage
