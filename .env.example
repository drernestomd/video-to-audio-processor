# Video to Audio API Environment Configuration

# Vercel Blob Storage (Required)
# Get this from your Vercel dashboard under Storage > Blob
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here

# Railway Processing Service (Optional - enables fast processing)

# Optional: Render Processing Service (Alternative to Railway)
# RENDER_PROCESSING_URL=https://your-render-service.onrender.com

# Vercel automatically sets these (no need to configure):
# VERCEL_URL - Your Vercel app URL
# VERCEL - Set to 1 when running on Vercel

# Configuration Notes:
# - RAILWAY_PROCESSING_URL is REQUIRED - service will not work without it
# - PROCESSING_SERVICE_TOKEN is REQUIRED for Railway authentication
# - WEBHOOK_SECRET is REQUIRED for secure webhook communication
# - Railway processing can handle long videos without Vercel's timeout limits
# - No local processing fallback - Railway is the only processing option

# API_TIMEOUT=15
# MAX_FILE_SIZE=100
